Requirements for the Acumulus web shop extensions
=================================================

Note that this information will be updated regularly, but will be out-of-date
even faster. So the quick changelog here should give you an idea of the
recentness of this information.

Updates:

- System requirements: valid for 8.2.0.
- Supported shops and versions: july 2024.
- Supported PHP versions: july 2024.

System Requirements
-------------------

- PHP:
    * Minimum version: 8.0, older versions WILL fail.
    * Recommended version: 8.1, soon - probably plugin version 8.3, this will become the
      minimally required version and older versions WILL fail.
    * See the PHP versions table further below for which PHP version can be used for which
      shop.
    * Note: our own plugin/module has not yet been tested on PHP 8.2 or 8.3 ...
- Database:
    * MySql: 5.6 or later.
    * MariaDb: 10.0 or later.

Supported shops and versions
----------------------------
The tags below are also used further on in the changelog to indicate to which
shop(s) a change applies (if no tag is mentioned, ALL may be assumed).

Notes:

- The supported versions column is tricky. We only use the latest (locally
  installed) version of a shop for testing. New features of our module may use
  features of the shop as were available when our new feature was developed.
  As it is often not clear when a new API feature became available, this may
  unknowingly lead to our module failing on older versions of the shop (before
  that now used feature was available), and thus to us not updating the column
  "Supported versions" below.
- Joomla 5(.1) has not yet been tested, but will be in the near future.

Supported PHP versions
----------------------
This is an overview of which PHP version can be used with the supported shops.
This overview is not updated with each release of this plugin so may be a bit outdated.

Notes:

- Latest, or almost latest, point releases are used of the listed PHP versions.
- WooCommerce is listed in combination with WordPress 6.6 Note that other plugins gave
  warnings in my test environment, but those were paid plugins that I cannot upgrade, and
  thus for which I have an outdated version.
- Other installed plugins/modules may not have been updated to the latest
  PHP version as supported by the shop or our plugin, or may, on the contrary,
  already require a newer version than the shop does. This table cannot keep
  track of that.
