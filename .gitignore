# Ignore dependencies that are managed with Composer.
# As we have only require-devs, we do not deliver /vendor/ to our users of the library,
# so we do not commit it, so users will not see it.
# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that any other vendor directories are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
