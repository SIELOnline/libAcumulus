/**
 * DiscountLineCollector contains HikaShop specific {@see LineType::Discount} collecting
 * logic.
 *
 * Discounts in HikaShop seem to be a bit faulty.
 * - I could not get automatic taxes (property of a coupon) to work, not with coupons
 *   before, nor after taxes (setting under Config - Taxes).
 * - If you change a coupon from non-automatic to automatic, you leave a "dangling"
 *   tax-rate, which will be used instead of automatic tax rate selection.
 * - You could say that coupons after taxes are vouchers, because no vat is registered.
 *
 * Notes (comments copied over from the old Creator):
 * - HikaShop knows discounts in the form of coupons or unrestricted discounts.
 *   Coupons can be without vat (to be seen as partial payment, which was
 *   probably not meant, thus incorrect) or with a fixed vat rate, independent
 *   of the products in the cart, thus also incorrect.
 * - When a cart with a coupon contains products with another vat rate, the
 *   shown vat amount breakdown is incorrect. The Acumulus invoice will be
 *   correct, but may differ from the shop invoice, though the overall amount
 *   tends to be equal. It is the metadata in the invoice (as sent to Acumulus)
 *   that shows the differences.
 *
